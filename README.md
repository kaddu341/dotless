# dotless
Repository for the "Dotless" AI-powered mobile keyboard for the Arabic script.

"Dotless" is a vision for a mobile keyboard app for the Arabic script which reduces the number of keys by using AI to differentiate between similar letters (e.g. ج،ح،خ) based on context, thereby drastically simplifying the layout and making it easier for users to type.
